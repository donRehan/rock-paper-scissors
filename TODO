			---- EASY PEAZY LEMON SQUEZY ----

			---- UI Part ----
PLAN WITH PEN AND PAPER BEFORE CONTINUING 
MAKE SURE TO CREATE TESTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE TOO

[x] Make the game run in the console and you interact using the buttons
	?! (Initially ofc)
[_] Comment the code to be easily understood for good practice !
[x] Change the wallpaper color 
[x] Make Round Text clearer
[x] Make Score design clearer
[x] Adjust that the game is pushed down each round , make it more uniform

[x] Add Computer Choice / User Choice area

BUGS
[x] Game once text incremented I cannot scroll down , Why ??
	Maybe because of adding text how can I fix it ? Maybe create empty text elements
	Work on just changing their content rather than just adding text
	Understand DOM's part in here
[x] On larger screens like my other screen the whole look of the site is not right
	[Fixed by setting justify content to space between instead of center]
